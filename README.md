Spells is a CLI utilty to read, print, and filter spells from an RPG.

Features:
* Reads from specified csv files into program memory.
* Entering a spell name prints the relevant information about it, nicely formatted.
* Using the filter system allows the user to specify filters and print lists of spells that match.
* Autocompletion of names.
